The excavation sites are abandoned after work is complete, rendering the land useless. Industries contribute to land degradation in multiple ways. Mineral processing, like grinding limestone for cement, generates massive amounts of dust that settles on land, inhibiting water infiltration. Industrial effluents and waste discharged onto land and into water bodies pollute the land and soil, reducing its fertility and making it toxic.\",\"Rubrics\":\"3 Marks. 1 mark for explaining the impact of surface mining (scars, overburden). 2 marks for explaining the impact of industries (dust from processing, industrial effluents).\",\"Total_Score\":3}",

Formation: It is a result of intense leaching due to heavy rain, where lime and silica are leached away. 2. Fertility: The humus content of the soil is low because most micro-organisms, particularly decomposers like bacteria, get destroyed due to high temperature. This makes the soil less fertile. 3. Suitability: After adopting appropriate soil conservation techniques and with adequate doses of manures and fertilizers, it can be made suitable for cultivation.
